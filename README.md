# 27FourAssessment
The purpose of this assignment is to allow you to demonstrate your understanding of OO principles and  techniques (think re-usability, maintainability, flexibility etc). Creativity and elegance is also valued. You  should not focus on producing performance-optimized code or ‘as-little-code-as-possible’ to the  detriment of readability and maintainability.  The assignment is designed to be completed within 2 to 4 hours. You may however choose to expend  more time, at your own discretion. You are encouraged to add documentation (think todo’s and fixme’s)  to indicate portions of the design or code that you would do differently given more time. Most importantly, your code must work. Code that does not compile or produce output will not be  evaluated
